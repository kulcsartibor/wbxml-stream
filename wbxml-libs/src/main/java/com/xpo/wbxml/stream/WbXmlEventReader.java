/**
 * <p>Class that implements the XMlEventReader for the WbXML format. It uses

 * 
 * <p>It was deeply considered to just implement this reader as a class
 * that extends XMLStreamReaderImpl. This class is the internal class in javaSE
 * that implements XMLEventReader. There is a constructor which uses a 
 * XMLStreamReader, so it could have been implemented just using that class
 * and creating it using a WbXmlStreamReader. Some tests were done and it was
 * perfectly functional. Besides that solution would have been saved the 
 * implementation of any event. But finally it was decided to implement
 * the real WbXmlEventReader to avoid being dependant of internal JavaSE classes</p>
